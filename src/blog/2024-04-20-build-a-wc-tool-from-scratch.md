Recently, I have been looking for personal projects to work on that don't follow the backend norm -- CRUD. Fortunately, I stumbled on [this guy](https://x.com/@johncrickett) on X, his name is John Crickett. He posts coding challenges every weekend and they look like a challenge.

For my first article, I will be attempting the [wc tool challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/) and sharing my thought process.

Let's go!

### A very short intro to wc tool

WC short for word count is a terminal utility tool used for counting words, characters, bytes, and lines in a file or standard input. 

Yeah. That's it. If you're interested in an in-depth explanation of the workings of the wc util, you can check its manual in your terminal using this command:

`man wc`

### The thought process
Now you understand what the wc util does, let's set the foundation for what we're about to build.
